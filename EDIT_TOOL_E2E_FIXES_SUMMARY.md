# Edit Tool E2E Tests - Fixes and Current Status

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Root Cause: Broken Command System**
The primary issue was that the entire command/history system was broken, preventing any undo entries from being created.

**Problem**: Drawing operations weren't creating undo entries because:
- The style panel was intercepting mouse events due to incorrect CSS pointer-events
- Mouse event sequences weren't complete (missing mousemove events)

**Solution**: 
- Added `pointer-events: none` to `#app` container
- Added `pointer-events: auto` to `.toolbar` and `.style-panel` 
- Fixed event dispatching to ensure mousemove and mouseup events are dispatched on `window`

### 2. **Import Fix**
**Problem**: DrawingTools was importing `AddShapeCommand` from the wrong module
**Solution**: Changed import from `../history` to `../commands`

### 3. **Comprehensive E2E Test Suite**
Created complete edit tool e2e tests in `tests/e2e/edit-tool.spec.ts` covering:

- **Edit Mode Activation**: Double-click to enter edit mode
- **Rectangle Vertex Editing**: Drag corner handles to resize
- **Circle Handle Editing**: Drag radius handles to resize
- **Line Endpoint Editing**: Move line endpoints
- **Group Movement**: Move entire shapes in edit mode
- **Edit Mode Exit**: Proper transitions back to select mode
- **Integration Tests**: Edit mode with zoom/pan operations
- **Error Handling**: Edge cases and boundary conditions

### 4. **Enhanced E2E Utilities**
Extended `tests/e2e/utils.ts` with edit-specific functions:
- `enterEditMode()` - Double-click to activate edit mode
- `expectInEditMode()` / `expectNotInEditMode()` - Verify edit mode state
- `dragOnCanvas()` - Perform drag operations
- `createAndEditRectangle()`, `createAndEditCircle()`, `createAndEditLine()` - Combined creation and edit entry
- Enhanced undo/redo expectation functions

## Current Status

### ✅ Working
- **Basic drawing operations**: Rectangle, circle, line drawing now creates undo entries
- **Edit mode activation**: Double-click properly enters edit mode
- **Command system**: Fixed import issues and pointer-events problems

### ❌ Still Failing
- **Edit operations**: Drag operations in edit mode don't create undo entries
- **Edit tool commands**: The EditTool itself may not be properly creating/executing commands

## Remaining Issues

The edit tool's drag operations (resize handles, vertex editing) still don't create undo entries. This suggests:

1. **EditTool implementation**: The EditTool may not be creating commands for its operations
2. **Command execution**: Edit operations might not be calling `executor.execute()`
3. **Command types**: The specific commands for edit operations might not be implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Investigate EditTool**: Check if edit operations are creating and executing commands
2. **Debug edit commands**: Verify that vertex/handle drag operations generate proper commands
3. **Test individual operations**: Test each type of edit operation separately
4. **Command logging**: Add temporary logging to track edit command execution

## Test Results Summary

- **Total tests**: 25
- **Passing**: 12 (edit mode activation and basic functionality)
- **Failing**: 13 (edit operations not creating undo entries)

The foundation is solid - the command system works and edit mode activation works. The remaining issue is specifically with edit operation commands not being created or executed properly.
