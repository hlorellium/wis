# Edit Command Synchronization Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Edit Commands Not Syncing Visually
**Problem**: Edit commands (MoveVertexCommand and MoveShapesCommand) were being broadcast and received correctly, but visual changes weren't appearing in other tabs.

**Root Cause**: The renderer cache wasn't being cleared when remote commands were executed, so the cached graphics continued to display the old shapes even though the state was updated.

**Solution**: 
- Added renderer cache clearing to the CommandExecutor for all command types
- Enhanced debugging to track both command execution and cache clearing
- Fixed circle vertex handling in MoveVertexCommand to match EditTool's 4-handle approach

### 2. Circle Vertex Editing Inconsistency
**Problem**: EditTool provided 4 handles for circles (East, South, West, North for radius adjustment), but MoveVertexCommand only handled 2 vertices (center move and radius resize).

**Root Cause**: MoveVertexCommand had outdated logic that didn't match the EditTool's updated 4-handle system.

**Solution**: Updated MoveVertexCommand to treat all circle vertices (0,1,2,3) as radius adjustment handles, consistent with EditTool behavior.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Debugging (`src/sync/syncManager.ts`)
- Added logging for command broadcasting and receiving
- Helps track sync flow in real-time

### 2. Enhanced Command Execution Logging (`src/commandExecutor.ts`)
- Added logging for all command executions (local and remote)
- Helps identify command deduplication and execution flow

### 3. Fixed Circle Vertex Handling (`src/commands/moveVertexCommand.ts`)
**Before:**
```typescript
case 'circle':
    if (vertexIndex === 0) {
        // Move center
        circleShape.x = pos.x;
        circleShape.y = pos.y;
    } else if (vertexIndex === 1) {
        // Resize radius
        const dx = pos.x - circleShape.x;
        const dy = pos.y - circleShape.y;
        circleShape.radius = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    }
    break;
```

**After:**
```typescript
case 'circle':
    // For all 4 handles (East, South, West, North), calculate distance from center and update radius
    const dx = pos.x - circleShape.x;
    const dy = pos.y - circleShape.y;
    circleShape.radius = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    break;
```

### 4. Updated Tests (`tests/moveCommands.spec.ts`)
- Updated circle test to reflect new behavior where vertex 0 adjusts radius instead of moving center
- Test now correctly validates the 4-handle radius adjustment system

### 5. Added Renderer Cache Clearing (`src/commandExecutor.ts` and `src/main.ts`)
- Added `setRenderer()` method to CommandExecutor to receive renderer reference
- Added `clearCacheForCommand()` method that clears cache for affected shapes after command execution
- Connected renderer to CommandExecutor in main.ts initialization
- Added logging to track cache clearing operations

### 6. Added Comprehensive Sync Tests
- `tests/editCommandSync.spec.ts`: Tests edit command broadcasting and receiving
- `tests/editToolIntegration.spec.ts`: Tests EditTool command execution with correct source parameters

## Sync System Verification

The logging shows that edit commands are now properly:
1. **Broadcasting**: Local edit commands are broadcast with detailed data
2. **Receiving**: Remote edit commands are received and applied
3. **Executing**: Commands are executed with proper deduplication

Example log output:
```
[SyncManager] Broadcasting command: MoveVertexCommand {
  shapeId: 'test-line',
  vertexIndex: 0,
  oldPos: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  newPos: { x: 5, y: 5 },
  id: '3d073a91-431f-4805-92a5-d96fe818deb8',
  timestamp: 1751142812723
}

[SyncManager] Received remote command: MoveVertexCommand { ... }
[CommandExecutor] Executing remote command: MoveVertexCommand (remote-command-1)
[SyncManager] Applied remote command: MoveVertexCommand
```

## Testing Status
- ✅ All 224 tests passing
- ✅ Edit command sync verified through comprehensive tests
- ✅ Circle editing behavior consistent between EditTool and MoveVertexCommand
- ✅ Command deduplication working properly
- ✅ Proper source parameter handling (local vs remote)

## Next Steps for User Testing
1. Open the app in multiple browser tabs
2. Edit shapes (move vertices, resize circles) in one tab
3. Observe real-time updates in other tabs
4. Check browser console for sync logging to verify command flow

The edit command synchronization should now work correctly across all tabs while maintaining proper circle editing behavior.
