# Foundation Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the foundation improvements made to the canvas drawing app to enhance code quality, maintainability, and consistency.

## 1. Centralized Selection Management

### Problem
Selection clearing and tool switching logic was scattered across multiple files (EditTool, SelectTool, MouseHandler), leading to:
- Code duplication
- Inconsistent behavior
- Difficult maintenance
- Potential for bugs when logic gets out of sync

### Solution: SelectionManager Utility Class

Created `src/utils/selectionManager.ts` with centralized methods:

- `clear(state)` - Clears selection and auto-switches from "edit" to "select" mode
- `setSelection(state, shapeIds)` - Sets selection to specific shape IDs
- `addToSelection(state, shapeIds)` - Adds shapes to current selection
- `removeFromSelection(state, shapeIds)` - Removes shapes from selection
- `hasSelection(state)` - Checks if any shapes are selected
- `isSelected(state, shapeId)` - Checks if a specific shape is selected

### Benefits
- **Single point of truth** for selection logic
- **Consistent behavior** across all tools
- **Easier testing** with 27 comprehensive unit tests
- **Reduced bugs** from logic inconsistencies

### Files Updated
- `src/tools/selectTool.ts` - Now uses SelectionManager for all selection operations
- `src/input/mouse.ts` - Uses SelectionManager.hasSelection() for cleaner checks
- **Tests Added**: `tests/selectionManager.spec.ts` (27 tests)

## 2. Hit-Testing Constants Consolidation

### Problem
Magic numbers scattered throughout codebase for:
- Handle radius (8 pixels)
- Drag thresholds (5 pixels) 
- Line tolerance (5 pixels)
- Selection rectangle minimums
- Click tolerances

### Solution: HIT_CONFIG Constants

Added to `src/constants.ts`:

```typescript
export const HIT_CONFIG = {
    HANDLE_RADIUS: 8,           // Radius for edit handles (pixels)
    DRAG_THRESHOLD: 5,          // Minimum drag distance before considering it a drag
    LINE_TOLERANCE: 5,          // Tolerance for line hit-testing (pixels)
    SELECTION_RECT_MIN: 5,      // Minimum drag distance for selection rectangle
    CLICK_TOLERANCE: 5          // General click tolerance for hit-testing
} as const;
```

### Benefits
- **Easy configuration** - Change tolerances in one place
- **Consistent values** across all tools
- **Self-documenting** code with named constants
- **Easier testing** of boundary conditions

### Files Updated
- `src/constants.ts` - Added HIT_CONFIG section
- `src/tools/selectTool.ts` - Replaced magic numbers with HIT_CONFIG constants
- `src/tools/editTool.ts` - Replaced magic numbers with HIT_CONFIG constants

## 3. Integration Test Suite

### Problem
Unit tests covered individual components well, but lacked end-to-end testing of:
- Mouse interaction flows
- Tool transitions
- Selection workflows
- Keyboard interactions

### Solution: Comprehensive Integration Tests

Created `tests/mouseFlow.spec.ts` with 13 integration tests covering:

#### Basic Selection Flow
- Single-click shape selection
- Empty space click to clear selection
- Drag selection (window/crossing modes)

#### Edit Mode Transitions  
- Double-click to enter edit mode
- Auto-switch back to select mode when clearing selection
- Empty space clicks in edit mode

#### Drag Selection Behavior
- Drag selection after returning from edit mode
- No drag selection while in edit mode

#### Keyboard Interactions
- Delete/Backspace key handling
- Proper behavior when no selection exists

#### Force Render Callbacks
- Render triggering during drag operations
- Edit mode drag rendering

### Benefits
- **End-to-end validation** of user workflows
- **Confidence in refactoring** with comprehensive coverage
- **Documentation** of expected behavior through tests
- **Regression prevention** for complex interactions

## 4. Test Coverage Improvements

### Summary of Test Growth
- **Before**: 194 tests
- **After**: 207 tests (+13 tests)
- **New test files**: 
  - `tests/selectionManager.spec.ts` (27 tests)
  - `tests/mouseFlow.spec.ts` (13 integration tests)

### Test Categories Added
1. **SelectionManager Unit Tests** (27)
   - All public methods tested
   - Edge cases covered
   - Integration scenarios tested

2. **Mouse Flow Integration Tests** (13)
   - Real DOM event simulation
   - Full tool interaction chains
   - Keyboard + mouse combinations

## 5. Code Quality Improvements

### Eliminated Code Duplication
- **Before**: Selection clearing logic in 3+ places
- **After**: Single SelectionManager.clear() method

### Improved Type Safety
- All SelectionManager methods properly typed
- Constants exported with `as const` for literal types
- Integration tests use proper typing

### Enhanced Maintainability
- Constants now have descriptive names and comments
- Centralized selection logic easier to modify
- Integration tests serve as living documentation

## 6. Performance Considerations

### Current State
- No performance regressions introduced
- Constants are compile-time resolved
- SelectionManager uses efficient array operations

### Future Optimizations Ready
The improved foundation sets up for future optimizations:
- Preview/commit pattern for drag operations
- Dirty-list caching in Path2DRenderer
- Performance monitoring hooks in place

## 7. Development Workflow Impact

### Benefits for Developers
- **Faster debugging** with centralized selection logic
- **Easier feature additions** with clear patterns established
- **Reduced cognitive load** with named constants vs magic numbers
- **Higher confidence** when making changes due to test coverage

### Code Review Benefits
- **Clearer intent** with named constants and utility methods
- **Easier verification** of selection behavior
- **Test coverage** visible in pull requests

## Next Steps

This foundation improvement sets the stage for:

1. **Preview/Commit Pattern** - Separate visual preview from state mutation during drags
2. **Keyboard UX** - ESC key handling, tool shortcuts
3. **Path2DRenderer Optimization** - Dirty-list caching for better performance
4. **Code Structure** - Split large files into focused modules
5. **Type Safety** - Remove remaining `any` types
